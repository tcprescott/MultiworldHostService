# MultiworldHostService
A simple hosting service for Bonta's (and others) implementations of ALTTPR Multiworld

Ensure that the directory containing the MultiServer.py and MultiClient.py is included in the PYTHONPATH.

`PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/opt/multiworld/MultiWorld-Utilities`

Works with Berserker's fork of the Bonta ALTTPR Multiworld implementation.
